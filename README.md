# Clock-Synchronization-
Implementation of clock synchronization in Distributed Systems - a simple UDP client/server program, where the client sends a request to the server and the server sends a reply to the client. The client records the local clock times (client machine) of when the request is sent and when the reply is received. The serverâ€™s reply contains the local clock time (server machine) of when the request is received and when the reply is sent.
